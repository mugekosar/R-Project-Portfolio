# dataset joins in R

## Overview
This project illustrates how to combine datasets using the merge() function, a crucial data science technique for linking related observations across multiple sources, often revealing deeper insights.

## Files
- `dataset-joins.Rmd`: The R Markdown source file with the analysis code and narrative.
- `dataset-joins.html`: The rendered HTML file from the R Markdown document.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `dataset-joins.Rmd` in RStudio.
3. Install any required packages using:
   `install.packages("dplyr")`
   `install.packages("pander")`
   `install.packages("readr")`
   `install.packages("tidyr")`
   `install.packages("tibble")`
   `install.packages("scales")`
4. Please ensure that you load these packages in your R session before executing the code by using:
   `library( dplyr )`
   `library( pander )` 
   `library( readr )` 
   `library( tidyr )` 
   `library( tibble )` 
   `library( scales )` 


5. Run the Rmd file to reproduce the analysis and generate the HTML report.

## Requirements
- R
- RStudio
- Listed R packages on the above.
