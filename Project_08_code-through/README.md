# code through in R

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a flight dataset to predict delays using regression models. It includes data wrangling, transformation, and an introduction to Logistic Regression, KNN, and Naive Bayes models. The analysis will explore delays by reason and departure times, with performance visualized through confusion matrices. The data, sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, focuses on January and April 2022 flights from Atlanta by Delta, Spirit, and Frontier Airlines.

## Files
- `code-through.Rmd`: The R Markdown source file with the analysis code and narrative.
- `code-through.html`: The rendered HTML file from the R Markdown document.
- `dataset.xlxs`: The dataset for the analysis

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `code-through.Rmd` in RStudio.
3. Install any required packages using:
   `install.packages("dplyr")`
   `install.packages("kableExtra")`
   `install.packages("readxl")`
   `install.packages("dplyr")`
   `install.packages("tidyverse")`
   `install.packages("ggplot2")`
   `install.packages("lattice")`
   `install.packages("caret")`
   `install.packages("RColorBrewer")`
   `install.packages("class")`
   `install.packages("e1071")`
   `install.packages("caTools")`
4. Please ensure that you load these packages in your R session before executing the code by using:
   `library( dplyr )`
   `library( kableExtra )` 
   `library( readxl )` 
   `library( dplyr )`
   `library( tidyverse )` 
   `library( ggplot2 )` 
   `library( lattice )` 
   `library( caret )` 
   `library( RColorBrewer )` 
   `library( class )` 
   `library( e1071 )` 
   `library( caTools )` 
5. Run the Rmd file to reproduce the analysis and generate the HTML report.
